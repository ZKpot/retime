## ReTime
A demo for 3D game engine [Dotrix](https://github.com/lowenware/dotrix).

## Controls
- Goal is to reach the __flag__ with the __ball__ as fast as possible
- Use __WASD__ to control the ball
- Collect __hourglasses__ to be able to rewind time
- Press __Space__ to rewind time (when space is relesed the game will play all the actions applied to the ball back unless overriden)
- Use __Left/Right arrows__ to switch between active objects (see the left bottom corner) to control them
- Press __E__ to use active object (e.g. trampoline to throw the ball up) when selected
- A trampoline (usualy located on the floor) can be activated with its activation button (usually located on a wall)

## Level design
- New levels can be added to the game by creating a new __*.yaml__ file in the _levels_ folder (see the existing levels as examples)
- New levels are automatically loaded when launching the game
- New level models should be placed in _assets/levels_ folder
